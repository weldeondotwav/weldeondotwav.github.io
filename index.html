            ive bounced back and forth with web technologies for a while with this site, and i think it's time
            i go in fresh and just really truly go grug and hack something for the fun of it
        </p>
        <p>
            i know i want something simple, so to set the tone im starting with this index.html file, and i'll
            build up whatever i need as we go.
        </p>
        <p>
            i am gonna go ahead and set up one big piece of infrastructure though, which is hosting. that way i can
            always have the site live as it evolves. currently this repository is served on github pages.
            i do have a home server running a gitea instance though, and i'd like to make use of it and use that as my
            git remote. to do this, the github repository for this site is driven by a push mirror from my gitea server.
            in the future, i could set up any build automation that i need to do (though i would like to try to not do
            any
            crazy setups, i really do want to keep this simple) on my gitea runner which would then commit back
            to the repository, and then be pushed to github for static hosting.
