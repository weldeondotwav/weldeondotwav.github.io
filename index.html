    <p>
        ive bounced back and forth with web technologies for a while with this site, and i think it's time
        i go in fresh and just really truly go grug and hack something for the fun of it
    </p>
    <p>
        i know i want something simple, so to set the tone im starting with this index.html file, and i'll 
        build up whatever i need as we go.
    </p>
    <p>
        i am gonna go ahead and set up one big piece of infrastructure though, which is hosting. that way i can 
        always have the site live as it evolves. currently this repository is served on github pages.
        i do have a home server running a gitea instance though, and i'd like to make use of it and use that as my
        git remote. to do this, the github repository for this site is driven by a push mirror from my gitea server.
        in the future, i could set up any build automation that i need to do (though i would like to try to not do any
        crazy setups, i really do want to keep this simple) on my gitea runner which would then commit back
        to the repository, and then be pushed to github for static hosting.
